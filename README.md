# GCL Lean

Formalization of the GCL language and associated semantics and analysis in Lean 4. Based on the book _Formal Methods: An Appetizer_ by Flemming Nielson and Hanne Riis Nielson.

## Building the project

To build the project, one needs to install Lean. The recommended approach is to use VS Code as listed [here](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html). If you prefer the CLI, install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and run `lake build`.
